# Final Project Proposal

### Are you working alone or with someone else?
Zane and Payton.

### How are you going to plan/coordinate work on the project?
We will meet twice a week as well as dedicating as much time as possible outside of meeting to work async on the project.

### What dataset will you use?
We plan on utilizing NOAA's data on wildfires specifically the NOAA GOES-R Series Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) Level 2 Fire/Hot Spot Characterization (FDC). You can find this data base using the following link: https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/collections/details/d9303237-8672-4917-a251-29c3f7640684 and https://data.noaa.gov/onestop/collections?q=satellite 

### What is your starting hypothesis?
Our hypothesis is that we can create a accurate predictive model of a specific disaster type that can be used to inform response strategies.
Alternatively our model could not be accurate enough to effectively predict disaster outcomes.

### What models do you plan to apply to your data?
We will be using an ensemble of models to analyze satellite imagery and subsequently produce predictions
First we will most likely use some type of CNN for image analysis, we have to do more research on subsequent models to apply to produce predictions
